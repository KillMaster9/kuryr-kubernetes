    [`bug 1782404 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystonemiddleware/+bug/1782404>`_]
    Keystonemiddleware incorrectly implemented an abstraction for the memcache
    client pool that utilized a `queue.Queue` `get` method instead of the
    supplied `acquire()` context manager. The `acquire()` context manager
    properly places the client connection back into the pool after `__exit__`.
