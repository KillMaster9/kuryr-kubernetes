    For services such as Swift, which may not be utilizing oslo_config, we need
    to be able to determine the project name from local config. If project
    name is specified in both local config and oslo_config, the one in local
    config will be used instead.

    In case project is undetermined (i.e. not set), we use taxonomy.UNKNOWN as
    an indicator so operators can take corrective actions.
