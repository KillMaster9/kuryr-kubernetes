    [`bug/1747655 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystonemiddleware/+bug/1747655>`_]
    When keystone is temporarily unavailable, keystonemiddleware correctly
    sends a 503 response to the HTTP client but was not identifying which
    service was down, leading to confusion on whether it was keystone or the
    service using keystonemiddleware that was unavailable. This change
    identifies keystone in the error response.
