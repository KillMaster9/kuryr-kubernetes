    The auth_uri parameter of keystone_authtoken is deprecated in favor of
    www_authenticate_uri. The auth_uri option was often confused with the
    auth_url parameter of the keystoneauth plugin, which was also effectively
    always required. The parameter refers to the WWW-Authenticate header that is
    returned when the user needs to be redirected to the Identity service for
    authentication.
