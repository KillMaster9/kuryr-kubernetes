    Removes ``pycrypto`` dependency as the library is unmaintained, and
    replaces it with the ``cryptography`` library.

    [`bug 1677308 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystonemiddleware/+bug/1677308>`_]
    There is no upgrade impact when switching from ``pycrypto`` to
    ``cryptography``.  All data will be encrypted and decrypted using identical
    blocksize, padding, algorithm (AES) and mode (CBC). Data previously
    encrypted using ``pycrypto`` can be decrypted using both ``pycrypto`` and
    ``cryptography``.  The same is true of data encrypted using
    ``cryptography``.
