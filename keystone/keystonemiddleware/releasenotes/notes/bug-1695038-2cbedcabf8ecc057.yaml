    [`bug 1695038 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystonemiddleware/+bug/1695038>`_]
    The use_oslo_messaging configuration option is added for services such as
    Swift, which need the audit middleware to use the local logger instead of
    the oslo.messaging notifier regardless of whether the oslo.messaging package
    is present or not.
    Leave this option set to its default True value to keep the previous behavior
    unchanged - the audit middleware will use the oslo.messaging notifier if the
    oslo.messaging package is present, and the local logger otherwise.
    Services that rely on the local logger for audit notifications must set this
    option to False.
