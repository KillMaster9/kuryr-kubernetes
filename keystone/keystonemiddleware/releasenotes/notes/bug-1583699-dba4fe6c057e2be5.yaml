    [`bug 1583699 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystonemiddleware/+bug/1583699>`_]
    Some service APIs (such as Swift list public containers) do not require
    a token. Therefore, there will be no identity or service catalog
    information available. In these cases, audit now fills in the default
    (i.e. taxonomy.UNKNOWN) for both initiator and target instead of raising
    an exception.
