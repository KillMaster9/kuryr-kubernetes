    [`bug 1583702 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystonemiddleware/+bug/1583702>`_]
    Some services such as Swift does not use Oslo (global) config. In that
    case, the options are conveyed via local config. This patch utilized
    an established pattern in auth_token middleware, which is to first
    look for the given option in local config, then Oslo global config.
