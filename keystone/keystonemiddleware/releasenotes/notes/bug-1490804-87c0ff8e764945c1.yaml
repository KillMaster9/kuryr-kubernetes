    [`CVE-2015-7546 <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7546>`_]
    A bug is fixed where an attacker could avoid token revocation when the PKI
    or PKIZ token provider is used. The complete remediation for this
    vulnerability requires the corresponding fix in the Identity (keystone)
    project.
